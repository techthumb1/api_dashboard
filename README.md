# API  Dashboard

In the pursuit of a better user experience, the API Dashboard is a new feature that allows you to view the API in a more intuitive way. When valuable KPIs are available, the Dashboard will display them in a more meaningful way using Python. The Dashboard is a web application that can be accessed from your browser using the Panel URL to view the API dashboard. 

This project will be a compliment to the BLS application covering factors such as: CPI, Inflation, Wages and Unemployment, and more.
